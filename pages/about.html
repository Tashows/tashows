        My name is Tasos Maschalidis. I've recently switched from being the Audio
        Guy to being the Developer. Yeah, I tend to switch from one rockstar 
        career to the next one. And I am awesome every time. Just wait till being an astronaut has a Udemy course!
        My biggest achievement so far is <a href="https://www.photocontest.gr">photocontest.gr</a>, a greek photography 
        community web app, that hosts contests and connects photographers. It 
        features many cool... features, but I won't spoil the mystery. Random stuff 
        about me: I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce">VSause</a> 
        and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt">Kurzgesagt</a>.
        I enjoy learning new stuff and facing new challenges every day! 
        Self-taught web developer, veteran in manipulating anything digital
        and a gamer who loves everything from Tetris to Dota2. In one word: geek.
